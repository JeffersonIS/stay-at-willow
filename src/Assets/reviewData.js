The kitchen had plenty of room for multiple people to be cooking. Lots of parking for multiple cars and we enjoyed walking in the nearby neighborhood. Big bonus - a winery is right next door! Such a beautiful space.',

Makes the place feel so large and you can’t beat that view! Love all the natural lighting. Wish this was my own home :) Delene had great check in/check out instructions. Super easy to follow. If we had any questions, she provided a folder of FAQ’s and that was amazing help! Not going to stay in any other Airbnb when we visit Tri Cities. Recommending this to all our family and friends :)',

We visit the Tri-Cities yearly, and I know we will be booking here again. The home was spotless, spacious, and had everything needed for a comfortable stay. The house also looks to have been recently renovated with all modern amenities and a clean, fresh design. Nestled near several local vineyards, the location is both peaceful and quiet. Delene was great to work with. She knows the area super well, and offered several great activities and restaurants to try during our stay. We couldn’t have asked for more, and can’t wait to come back!',

        text: 'This is a beautiful and comfortable house. The kitchen has more than enough dishes, pots & pans, utensils and gadgets. And the kitchen itself is gorgeous. The photos dont do it justice. The east side of the house is mostly windows and the view is spectacular. And theres a winery with a tasting room next door. So if you want to visit all of the local wineries, this is the place for you. The host is very responsive. Check in was a breeze. We were a party of 8 and all of the beds were very comfy. There is a designated work space downstairs which was great. The whole house was squeaky clean. We would definitely stay here again.',
